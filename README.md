Group Member Roles:


Jeremy Roalef - Script refactoring, adding VR fundamentals (XR Origin, locomotion, interactables), and gameplay design

Anthony Ulysse - UI interactions, start scene requirements, audio and SFX.

.

Enhancements:

-Transitioning a first person shooter video game into a VR game

-Fine tuning VR locomotion with continuous move turn providers, providing a smoother flow of movement

-Adjusting locomotion systems for right controller based on active weapon state

-Adding SFX for the base game, adding immersion in so doing

-Added weapon toggling and ammo crates that target specific ammo types.

-Customized UI design to VR design requirements (i.e., using world space canvases instead of overlay canvases)

-Added scene transitions from game back to main menu and vise versa


.


Lessons Learned:

-Building a base VR video game is tricky, but doable. Once you get the VR fundamentals built, you are open to create anything. For this reason, video lecture 1.4 in GameDev.tv's VR course was the most important course lecture for our game's development

-Transitioning a video game from a 3D environment to a VR video game is relatively straightforward. The only problems we experienced in the transition process was with UI, locomotion, and interactions. Otherwise, the process was straightforward

-Reusing scripts from course lectures and implementing them into a new game environment improved our efficiency in the VR game's development. Scripts like the button interactable in lecture 4.2, the simple hinge in lecture 5.2, and the audio manager from the lectures 7.1 to 7.7 proved
 to be very useful in getting functionalities and audio set up in our game.

-We gained new and valuable insight into the power of Unity's event actions and how we can use it to structure our code into an easy-to-follow flow of logic. Course lectures like lecture 3.4 showed us how event systems can be used for VR game development.

-We learned new lessons in separating work among group members to streamline the game development process. By separating work, we were able to focus on game requirements without needing to stress about having too much work to complete
